# Answers

## Task B
Which one has the lowest variance?  
Task A has lowest variance  
The lowest maximum? Why?  
Task A  
Does the response for A, B and C look the same?  
Looks the same because they look random

## Task C
How do the timings compare to the polling solution? Do A, B and C have the same response time? Why/why not?  
The timings for A are close to itself, so are B and C.

## Task D
Bad method:
Task B and C are delay with about 100 microseconds  

Big while:
For the deferred technique: Is it faster or slower, and why?  
About the same, but with less variance in big while

For the ”expensive B” response: Which solution had the least impact on the response for A and C?  
With big while the A is slower, but C is faster.
